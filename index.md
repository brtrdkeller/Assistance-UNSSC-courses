## Support for accessibility improvement

Legal obligations may force organizations to carry out full audits of their application, with the aim of correcting all accessibility issues.

However, these issues are never corrected all at once. It's a question of setting up an improvement process. This website is designed to help you put this process in place.

To do this, it is oriented to target the major issues present on the website. This is in line with the demands of some accessibility experts for the WCAG to evolve.


## Website organization

3 reports are available in the main navigation menu.


### 1. Accessibility Report 

This page contains all the information contained in the audit grid (available for download).

A WCAG audit is carried out page by page, identifying issues even if they are repeated, and without the obligation of noting all the errors encountered. We're interested in the audit proof. If an issue occurs 100 times on a page, the 100 issues are not noted.

So we use a recommendation report to make corrections understandable to a development team.

The content provides a more synthetic view of errors without having to open an `xls` document.

### 2. User Test Report

This report shows how a disabled person navigates the site. 

Part of the test consists of accessing pages or content. Another part consists of performing actions considered essential on the website. 

### 3. Recommendations Report

The recommendation report is correction-oriented. It will potentially bring together several accessibility issues in a single recommendation, including accessibility issues that are not tested in the WCAG.

We'll have a qualitative vision of the code, to ensure cleaner code, but also to promote relations between the various people involved in the site.

The recommendation report does not always present all the corrections to be made. Instead, it will focus on critical issues that are easier to correct, with the aim of avoiding serious blockages for disabled users.
