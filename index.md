# Technical Assistance UNSSC

## Presentation

Moddle is a learning platform which is allready taking care about digital accessibility. UNSSC is asking to test a basic navigation, not the whole website (Because they can't act on it).

UNSCC create some development over the Moddle platform. They want us to test especially this specifics developments.

Be careful, we have only one authentification code. Maybe some parameters can be modified wether by Prashant or by testing users. It can affect bookmarking especially, or the progression in a course.

## Goals

1. Find the critical Issues
1. Find the more valuable Issues
1. Insist on specific component coded by UNSSC (Dashboard and Profile Page, I noted)
1. Communicate precisely on the main recommandation

## Tree Structure

### Login

 1. Home Page (Page who is redirecting to different courses platform, but not functional)
 2. Login (Login Form)
 3. Password forgotten (Form)

### Courses

 1. Dashboard or My Learning (The both are present only on this test platform)
 2. Course Catalogue (Landing page of a search)
 3. Course Unit (Called "Best Value Unit")

### My account

 1. My profile
 2. Preferences (Only for users test)
    1. Notification Preference
    2. Change Password

## Basic idea for User tests

### I forgot my password
 
I can't connect on the login page. I think I forgot my password, I would like to have another.

### I want to change my password

I'm afraid someone took my password and find I'm following certains courses or make me fail certificate.

### I want to mute notifications

Notifications are disturbing me. I would like to stop them.

### In "My learning page", I want to filter my course

I would like to find the list of completed courses.

### I'm looking for a course with "Money" in the title

Someone told me about a course I have to follow. The is the word "Money" in the title.

### I'm looking for a course with a specifice theme

I'm not a UN employe, I'm looking Free course.

### I want to bookmark a course

I should have time next month, my manager told me to take advantage of this time for followinf some courses. I would like to bookmark some of them. 

### I want to check my calendar

I subscribe some courses, I have to plan my week.

### I want to continue the course I left.

I think, I left a course in the middle. Can I continue it, exactly where I stopped.

### I want to contact the site support

I'm blocked in the website. I have to contact the support team. 

## What not to test

1. The message icon in the main menu (in the header) with the long menu.
1. Help center is not a priority
1. The content of a course
1. Messageres, private files, Reports, Calendar page
